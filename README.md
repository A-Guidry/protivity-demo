Thank you for taking the time out to learn more about my project. This FAQ will help explain some of the issues/limitations of the demo. 

ABOUT Potivity

Potivity Demo is NOT a full working program and will only go a maximum of 3 levels/menus deep in sections. No progress is saved if the webpage is refreshed and all settings will be restored. 

We are asking for feedback on the proof of concept template to gauge industry interest in building a fully functioning software suite and YOU can be apart of the final product. 

The future version of Fuse will include options for Human Resource, Sales and Admin departments. 

KNOWN ISSUES:

All around, the load times can be a little slow. Even after the page loads, the modules can take an extra 2-3 seconds to fully render, at which points the issue of scrolling or maneuvering will function normally. 

Mobile:

When scrolling on pages like Mail, Tasks, and Contacts, you will need to scroll from the right and left sides of pages, outside of the module content to start the scroll. After the modules have loaded, scrolling should be able to be performed anywhere on the page.
